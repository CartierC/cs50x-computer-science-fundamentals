# CS50x – Computer Science Fundamentals

## Overview
This repository contains my completed coursework from Harvard's CS50x program, structured to demonstrate foundational computer science principles relevant to cloud engineering, systems design, and backend development.

This project emphasizes:
- Algorithmic thinking
- Memory management
- Data structures
- Performance optimization
- Computational efficiency

These concepts directly support scalable cloud architecture and distributed systems.
